gcovr: Generate GCC code coverage reports

Flow:
    cc --> run-exe --> gcovr

Procedure:
    1. Compile the source code with GCC flags mentioned below to generate the '.gcno' file.
       The '.gcno' record file is generated after adding the GCC compile option '-ftest-coverage',
       which contains information for reconstructing the base block map and assigning source
       line numbers to blocks during the compilation process.

       CFLAGS: --coverage [or] -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage

       Example:
         gcc hello.c -o hello --coverage                [or]
         gcc hello.c -o hello -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage

    2. Run the user program './hello' to generate coverage data counts. This will generate the '.gcda' data file.

    3. Run 'gcovr' to print a tabular report on the console.

    4. You can also generate detailed HTML reports
       gcovr --html-details coverage.html
