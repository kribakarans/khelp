gcov: Generate GCC code coverage reports

Flow:
    cc --> run-exe --> gcov --> lcov --> genhtml

    Use GCOVR for user friendly

Procedure:
    1. Compile the source code with GCC flags mentioned below to generate the '.gcno' file.
       The '.gcno' record file is generated after adding the GCC compile option '-ftest-coverage',
       which contains information for reconstructing the base block map and assigning source
       line numbers to blocks during the compilation process.

        CFLAGS: --coverage [or] -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage

        Example:
          gcc hello.c -o hello --coverage                [or]
          gcc hello.c -o hello -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage

    2. Run the user program './hello' to generate coverage data counts. This will generate the '.gcda' data file.

    3. Run gcov tool 'gcov hello.c' to convert this '.gcda' data into human readable file. This will generate the '.gcov' text file.
       Provide the -b option to gcov so that it will also report on the number of times various branches are taken.

       The '.gcov' file contain the : separated fields along with program source code in the format of <execution_count>:<line_number>:<source line text>.
         1. A count of the number of times the given line was executed
            A '-' indicates a line with no executable code (e.g. a declaration)
            A '#####' for lines which were never executed
         2. The line number
         3. The source code

    4. Generating HTML reports
       1. Generate the coverage.info data file
          lcov --capture --directory . --output-file coverage.info

       2. Generate a report from this data file
          genhtml coverage.info --output-directory __html
