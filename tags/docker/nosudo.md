nosudo: Manage Docker as a non-root user

 Add user to 'docker' group to access docker without sudo prefix.

 1. Create the docker group (On some Linux distributions, the system automatically creates this group on dcoker install)
      sudo groupadd docker

 2. Add your user to the docker group
      sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

 3. Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated
    If you’re running Linux in a virtual machine, it may be necessary to restart the virtual machine for changes to take effect.
    Run the following command to activate the changes to groups:
      newgrp docker

 4. Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo
      docker run hello-world
