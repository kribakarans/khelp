In Bash, there are several other transformations that you can perform
on variables using parameter expansion syntax. Here are some examples:

    ${var^}: Transform the first character of var to uppercase.
    ${var^^}: Transform all characters in var to uppercase.
    ${var,}: Transform all characters in var to lowercase.
    ${var,,}: Transform all characters in var to lowercase.
    ${var@operator}: Perform a shell operation on the value of var, using the specified operator. Some common operators include:
        Q: Quote the value of var in a way that is safe to use as input to the shell.
        E: Escape the value of var in a way that is safe to use as input to eval.
        P: Perform pathname expansion on the value of var.
        A: Split the value of var into an array, using whitespace as the delimiter.
        a: Split the value of var into an array, using the value of IFS as the delimiter.
