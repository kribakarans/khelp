# Manage Git Repository Using Personal Access Token:

## Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT):
1. Log in to the GitHub.
2. Navigate to SETTING > DEVELOPER SETTINGS.
3. Click on the "Generate New Token" or "Create Token" button.
4. Provide a name of PAT to identify its purpose and select the required permissions based on your intended usage.
   For cloning repositories, the "repo" or "read" permissions are typically sufficient.
5. Click on the "Generate Token" button to generate your PAT.
6. Copy the generated token to your clipboard. PATs are sensitive and should be treated like passwords.

## Clone the repository with PAT:
   git clone https://<PAT>@github.com/username/repo.git

   #!/bin/bash
   export GITHUB_USER=username
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=PAT
   export GITHUB_REPOSITORY=<github-repo-name>
   git clone https://${GITHUB_USER}:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}

If this does not work you can use:
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
   username : <username>
   password : <PAT generated in step 1>
