# LD_PRELOAD

`LD_PRELOAD` is an environment variable in Linux that allows you to
specify a list of shared libraries to be loaded before all others.

## Syntax

```bash
LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/your/library.so <executable>
```

## Usage

### 1. Override Functions

   You can use `LD_PRELOAD` to override functions in a library with your own implementation.

   This is often used for debugging or adding custom behavior to existing programs.

### 2. Inject Code

   You can use `LD_PRELOAD` to inject code into a process.
   This is often done for instrumentation or monitoring purposes.

   Your library can contain code that runs before the program starts and after it ends,
   allowing you to perform actions such as logging, profiling, or other custom behavior.

### 3. Dynamic Linking

   `LD_PRELOAD` can also be used to load libraries with additional functionality before the
   standard libraries. This can be helpful for testing or debugging.

   Ensure that your library does not interfere with the normal operation of the program.

### 4. Avoiding Conflicts

   Be cautious when using `LD_PRELOAD` as it can potentially interfere with the normal operation of programs.

   It's essential to carefully design and test your preload library to avoid conflicts with the target application.

   Remember that the use of `LD_PRELOAD` might be restricted by security mechanisms in certain environments.
