Clean up unresolved header files in the project source

# Follow these steps:
1. Confirm that the project builds successfully before proceeding.
2. Comment out the header file inclusions in all files,
   then rebuild using 'make clean' and 'make'.
3. Based on the GCC errors, include the relevant header files one by one
   and rebuild.
4. Repeat this step until the build is successful.

# Next, we will clear out nested file inclusions.
1. Open each file and comment out individual #include statements,
   then verify the build status.
2. If the build fails, then the commented file is necessary.
3. If the build is successful without the commented file, then it is
   not needed and the #include statement should be permanently removed.
4. Repeat this process for all files. By the end, we should have the
   fine inclusion of header files."
