# LDconfig:

The `ldconfig` command is used to generate and update the `ld.so.cache` file. Typically, this command is run automatically during system updates or when new shared libraries are installed.
This command reads the library configuration file (usually /etc/ld.so.conf and files in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/) and updates the `ld.so.cache` database file based on the library paths specified.
The `ldconfig` command creates or updates the `ld.so.cache` file, and this file is then used by the dynamic linker/loader when programs are executed.
