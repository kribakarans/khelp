# Git Upstream Usage:

The term "upstream" refers to the main Git repository from which your local repository was cloned or forked.
When you clone a repository, Git automatically sets up a remote called "origin" that points to the repository you cloned from.
The branch on your local repository that corresponds to the branch on the remote repository is typically referred to as the "upstream" branch.

## Adding an Upstream Remote:
Fetch changes from the original repository that you forked from.
In this case, you can add the original repository as a remote and name it "upstream":

  `git remote add upstream <original_repository_url>`

## Syncing with Upstream:
After adding the upstream remote, you can `fetch` changes from it and `merge` them into your local branch
to keep your repository up-to-date with the original repository:

  `git fetch upstream`
  `git merge upstream/main`

## Setting Upstream Branch:
When pushing a branch to a remote repository for the first time, you might want to set the upstream branch
so that Git knows where to push future changes. This establishes a tracking relationship between your local
branch and the corresponding branch in the remote repository:

Allows you to use commands like `'git push'` and `'git pull'` without explicitly specifying the remote and branch every time.

  `git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch-name> <local-branch-name>`

**Example:**
  `git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master`

## Push Upstream:
This establishes a tracking relationship between your local branch and the remote branch.

  `git push -u <remote-name> <branch-name>`

**Example:**
  `git push -u origin master` (or) `git push --set-upstream origin master`

After this, you can simply use `'git push'` and `'git pull'` without specifying the remote and branch names, and
Git will automatically refer to the upstream branch you've set.

## Pulling Changes from Upstream:
To update your local repository with changes from the upstream repository, you can pull changes from the upstream branch into your local branch:

  `git pull upstream main`
